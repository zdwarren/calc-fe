# Calculator App Frontend

## Introduction

This repository hosts the frontend (FE) part of a calculator application designed to provide a simple yet powerful user interface for performing arithmetic calculations. The frontend is built with React, leveraging React Query for efficient server state management and Ant Design (antd) for a polished, user-friendly UI.

## Features

- **Modern UI**: Built with Ant Design for a responsive and intuitive user interface.
- **State Management**: Uses React Query for handling asynchronous data fetching, caching, and synchronization.
- **Dynamic Calculations**: Communicates with the backend to process and display calculation results.

## Installation

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), so you'll need Node.js version 10.16.0 or later.

Follow these steps to get the frontend running:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zdwarren/calc-fe.git
   cd calc-fe

2. **Install Dependencies**
Inside the project directory, install the necessary packages using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start the Development Server**
Start the app in development mode by running:

```bash
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

4. **Run Tests**

```bash
npm test
```
